# scripts

Things less used then bin.

monitors - allows forcing monitor settings - say in the office you have 2 27" and you want to use them.
Sometimes my gnome has problems with it. So this script forces settings.
wmctrl - when using monitors I would like to put apps to particular places... almost working...
saydone - shows message
xtitle - changes title of console
